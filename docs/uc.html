<pre>Never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by incompetence.
- Napoleon</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the interests of creating employment opportunities in the Java programming
field, I am passing on these tips from the masters on how to write code that is
so difficult to maintain, that the people who come after you will take years to
make even the simplest changes. Further, if you follow all these rules
religiously, you will even guarantee yourself a lifetime of employment, since no
one but you has a hope in hell of maintaining the code. Then again, if you
followed all these rules religiously, even you wouldn&#8217;t be able to maintain the
code!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t want to overdo this. Your code should not look hopelessly unmaintainable, just be that way. Otherwise it stands the risk of being rewritten or refactored.
General Principles</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum sonatur.
- Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To foil the maintenance programmer, you have to understand how he thinks. He has your giant program. He has no time to read it all, much less understand it. He wants to rapidly find the place to make his change, make it and get out and have no unexpected side effects from the change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He views your code through a toilet paper tube. He can only see a tiny piece of your program at a time. You want to make sure he can never get at the big picture from doing that. You want to make it as hard as possible for him to find the code he is looking for. But even more important, you want to make it as awkward as possible for him to safely ignore anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmers are lulled into complacency by conventions. By every once in a while, by subtly violating convention, you force him to read every line of your code with a magnifying glass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might get the idea that every language feature makes code unmaintainable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not so, only if properly misused.
Naming</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less."
- Lewis Carroll -- Through the Looking Glass, Chapter 6</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much of the skill in writing unmaintainable code is the art of naming variables and methods. They don&#8217;t matter at all to the compiler. That gives you huge latitude to use them to befuddle the maintenance programmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>New Uses For Names For Baby
Buy a copy of a baby naming book and you'll never be at a loss for variable names. Fred is a wonderful name, and easy to type. If you're looking for easy-to-type variable names, try adsf or aoeu if you type with a DSK keyboard.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Single Letter Variable Names
If you call your variables a, b, c, then it will be impossible to search for instances of them using a simple text editor. Further, nobody will be able to guess what they are for. If anyone even hints at breaking the tradition honoured since FØRTRAN of using i, j, and k for indexing variables, namely replacing them with ii, jj and kk, warn them about what the Spanish Inquisition did to heretics.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Creative Miss-spelling
If you must use descriptive variable and function names, misspell them. By misspelling in some function and variable names, and spelling it correctly in others (such as SetPintleOpening SetPintalClosing) we effectively negate the use of grep or IDE search techniques. It works amazingly well. Add an international flavor by spelling tory or tori in different theatres/theaters.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Be Abstract
In naming functions and variables, make heavy use of abstract words like it, everything, data, handle, stuff, do, routine, perform and the digits e.g. routineX48, PerformDataFunction, DoIt, HandleStuff and do_args_method.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">

<pre>A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S.
Use acronyms to keep the code terse. Real men never define acronyms; they understand them genetically.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Thesaurus Surrogatisation
To break the boredom, use a thesaurus to look up as much alternate vocabulary as possible to refer to the same action, e.g. display, show, present. Vaguely hint there is some subtle difference, where none exists. However, if there are two similar functions that have a crucial difference, always use the same word in describing both functions (e.g. print to mean "write to a file", "put ink on paper" and "display on the screen"). Under no circumstances, succumb to demands to write a glossary with the special purpose project vocabulary unambiguously defined. Doing so would be an unprofessional breach of the structured design principle of information hiding.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Use Plural Forms From Other Languages
A VMS script kept track of the "statii" returned from various "Vaxen". Esperanto , Klingon and Hobbitese qualify as languages for these purposes. For pseudo-Esperanto pluraloj, add oj. You will be doing your part toward world peace.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>CapiTaliSaTion
Randomly capitalize the first letter of a syllable in the middle of a word. For example ComputeRasterHistoGram().</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Reuse Names
Wherever the rules of the language permit, give classes, constructors, methods, member variables, parameters and local variables the same names. For extra points, reuse local variable names inside {} blocks. The goal is to force the maintenance programmer to carefully examine the scope of every instance. In particular, in Java, make ordinary methods masquerade as constructors.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Åccented Letters
Use accented characters on variable names. E.g.
    typedef struct { int i; } ínt; where the second ínt's í is actually i-acute. With only a simple text editor, it's nearly impossible to distinguish the slant of the accent mark.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Exploit Compiler Name Length Limits
If the compiler will only distinguish the first, say, 8 characters of names, then vary the endings e.g. var_unit_update() in one case and var_unit_setup() in another. The compiler will treat both as var_unit.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Underscore, a Friend Indeed
Use _ and __ as identifiers.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Mix Languages
Randomly intersperse two languages (human or computer). If your boss insists you use his language, tell him you can organise your thoughts better in your own language, or, if that does not work, allege linguistic discrimination and threaten to sue your employers for a vast sum.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Extended ASCII
Extended ASCII characters are perfectly valid as variable names, including ß, Ð, and ñ characters. They are almost impossible to type without copying/pasting in a simple text editor.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Names From Other Languages
Use foreign language dictionaries as a source for variable names. For example, use the German punkt for point. Maintenance coders, without your firm grasp of German, will enjoy the multicultural experience of deciphering the meaning.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Names From Mathematics
Choose variable names that masquerade as mathematical operators, e.g.:
    openParen = (slash + asterix) / equals;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Bedazzling Names
Choose variable names with irrelevant emotional connotation. e.g.:
    marypoppins = (superman + starship) / god; This confuses the reader because they have difficulty disassociating the emotional connotations of the words from the logic they're trying to think about.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Rename and Reuse
This trick works especially well in Ada, a language immune to many of the standard obfuscation techniques. The people who originally named all the objects and packages you use were morons. Rather than try to convince them to change, just use renames and subtypes to rename everything to names of your own devising. Make sure to leave a few references to the old names in, as a trap for the unwary.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>When To Use i
Never use i for the innermost loop variable. Use anything but. Use i liberally for any other purpose especially for non-int variables. Similarly use n as a loop index.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Conventions Schmentions
Ignore the Sun Java Coding Conventions, after all, Sun does. Fortunately, the compiler won't tattle when you violate them. The goal is to come up with names that differ subtlely only in case. If you are forced to use the capitalisation conventions, you can still subvert wherever the choice is ambigous, e.g. use both inputFilename and inputfileName. Invent your own hopelessly complex naming conventions, then berate everyone else for not following them.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Lower Case l Looks a Lot Like the Digit 1
Use lower case l to indicate long constants. e.g. 10l is more likely to be mistaken for 101 that 10L is. Ban any fonts that clearly disambiguate uvw wW gq9 2z 5s il17|!j oO08 `'" ;,. m nn rn {[()]}. Be creative.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Reuse of Global Names as Private
Declare a global array in module A, and a private one of the same name in the header file for module B, so that it appears that it's the global array you are using in module B, but it isn't. Make no reference in the comments to this duplication.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Recycling Revisited
Use scoping as confusingly as possible by recycling variable names in contradictory ways. For example, suppose you have global variables A and B, and functions foo and bar. If you know that variable A will be regularly passed to foo and B to bar, make sure to define the functions as function foo(B) and function bar(A) so that inside the functions A will always be referred to as B and vice versa. With more functions and globals, you can create vast confusing webs of mutually contradictory uses of the same names.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Recycle Your Variables
Wherever scope rules permit, reuse existing unrelated variable names. Similarly, use the same temporary variable for two unrelated purposes (purporting to save stack slots). For a fiendish variant, morph the variable, for example, assign a value to a variable at the top of a very long method, and then somewhere in the middle, change the meaning of the variable in a subtle way, such as converting it from a 0-based coordinate to a 1-based coordinate. Be certain not to document this change in meaning.</pre>

<pre>Cd wrttn wtht vwls s mch trsr
When using abbreviations inside variable or method names, break the boredom with several variants for the same word, and even spell it out longhand once in while. This helps defeat those lazy bums who use text search to understand only some aspect of your program. Consider variant spellings as a variant on the ploy, e.g. mixing International colour, with American color and dude-speak kulerz. If you spell out names in full, there is only one possible way to spell each name. These are too easy for the maintenance programmer to remember. Because there are so many different ways to abbreviate a word, with abbreviations, you can have several different variables that all have the same apparent purpose. As an added bonus, the maintenance programmer might not even notice they are separate variables.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>Misleading names
Make sure that every method does a little bit more (or less) than its name suggests. As a simple example, a method named isValid(x) should as a side effect convert x to binary and store the result in a database.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>m_
a naming convention from the world of C++ is the use of "m_" in front of members. This is supposed to help you tell them apart from methods, so long as you forget that "method" also starts with the letter "m".</pre>

<pre>Hungarian Notation
Hungarian Notation is the tactical nuclear weapon of source code obfuscation techniques; use it! Due to the sheer volume of source code contaminated by this idiom nothing can kill a maintenance engineer faster than a well planned Hungarian Notation attack. The following tips will help you corrupt the original intent of Hungarian Notation:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Insist on using "c" for const in C++ and other languages that directly enforce the const-ness of a variable.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Seek out and use Hungarian warts that have meaning in languages other than your current language. For example insist on the PowerBuilder "l_" and "a_ " {local and argument} scoping prefixes and always use the VB-esque style of having a Hungarian wart for every control type when coding to C++. Try to stay ignorant of the fact that megs of plainly visible MFC source code does not use Hungarian warts for control types.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Always violate the Hungarian principle that the most commonly used variables should carry the least extra information around with them. Achieve this end through the techniques outlined above and by insisting that each class type have a custom wart prefix. Never allow anyone to remind you that no wart tells you that something is a class. The importance of this rule cannot be overstated if you fail to adhere to its principles the source code may become flooded with shorter variable names that have a higher vowel/consonant ratio. In the worst case scenario this can lead to a full collapse of obfuscation and the spontaneous reappearance of English Notation in code!</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Flagrantly violate the Hungarian-esque concept that function parameters and other high visibility symbols must be given meaningful names, but that Hungarian type warts all by themselves make excellent temporary variable names.</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Insist on carrying outright orthogonal information in your Hungarian warts. Consider this real world example "a_crszkvc30LastNameCol". It took a team of maintenance engineers nearly 3 days to figure out that this whopper variable name described a const, reference, function argument that was holding information from a database column of type Varchar[30] named "LastName" which was part of the table's primary key. When properly combined with the principle that "all variables should be public" this technique has the power to render thousands of lines of source code obsolete instantly!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Use to your advantage the principle that the human brain can only hold 7 pieces of information concurrently. For example code written to the above standard has the following properties:
    a single assignment statement carries 14 pieces of type and name information.
    a single function call that passes three parameters and assigns a result carries 29 pieces of type and name information.
    Seek to improve this excellent, but far too concise, standard. Impress management and coworkers by recommending a 5 letter day of the week prefix to help isolate code written on 'Monam' and 'FriPM'.
    It is easy to overwhelm the short term memory with even a moderately complex nesting structure, especially when the maintenance programmer can't see the start and end of each block on screen simultaneously.</pre>

<pre>Hungarian Notation Revisited
One followon trick in the Hungarian notation is "change the type of a variable but leave the variable name unchanged". This is almost invariably done in windows apps with the migration from Win16 :- WndProc(HWND hW, WORD wMsg, WORD wParam, LONG lParam) to Win32 WndProc(HWND hW, UINT wMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) where the w values hint that they are words, but they really refer to longs. The real value of this approach comes clear with the Win64 migration, when the parameters will be 64 bits wide, but the old "w" and "l" prefixes will remain forever.</pre>

<pre>Arbitrary Names That Masquerade as Keywords
When documenting, and you need an arbitrary name to represent a filename use "file ". Never use an obviously arbitrary name like "Charlie.dat" or "Frodo.txt".

For example, good names for parameters or variables would be"bank", "blank", "class", "const ", "constant", "input", "key", "keyword", "kind", "output", "parameter" "parm", "system", "type", "value", "var" and "variable ". If you use actual reserved words for your arbitrary names, which would be rejected by your command processor or compiler, so much the better. If you do this well, the users will be hopelessly confused between reserved keywords and arbitrary names in your example, but you can look innocent, claiming you did it to help them associate the appropriate purpose with each variable.</pre>

Since global variables are "evil", define a structure to hold all the things you'd put in globals. Call it something clever like EverythingYoullEverNeed.

<pre>Hide Instances With Synonyms
Maintenance programmers, in order to see if they'll be any cascading effects to a change they make, do a global search for the variables named. This can be defeated by this simple expedient of having synonyms, such as
    #define xxx global_var // in file std.h
    #define xy_z xxx // in file ..\other\substd.h
    #define local_var xy_z // in file ..\codestd\inst.h These defs should be scattered through different include-files. They are especially effective if the include-files are located in different directories. The other technique is to reuse a name in every scope. The compiler can tell them apart, but a simple minded text searcher cannot. Unfortunately SCIDs in the coming decade will make this simple technique impossible. since the editor understands the scope rules just as well as the compiler.</pre>

<pre>Choosing The Best Overload Operator
In C++, overload +,-,*,/ to do things totally unrelated to addition, subtraction etc. After all, if the Stroustroup can use the shift operator to do I/O, why should you not be equally creative? If you overload +, make sure you do it in a way that i = i + 5; has a totally different meaning from i += 5; Here is an example of elevating overloading operator obfuscation to a high art. Overload the '!' operator for a class, but have the overload have nothing to do with inverting or negating. Make it return an integer. Then, in order to get a logical value for it, you must use '! !'. However, this inverts the logic, so [drum roll] you must use '! ! !'. Don't confuse the ! operator, which returns a boolean 0 or 1, with the ~ bitwise logical negation operator.</pre>

<pre>#define
#define in C++ deserves an entire essay on its own to explore its rich possibilities for obfuscation. Use lower case #define variables so they masquerade as ordinary variables. Never use parameters to your preprocessor functions. Do everything with global #defines. One of the most imaginative uses of the preprocessor I have heard of was requiring five passes through CPP before the code was ready to compile. Through clever use of defines and ifdefs, a master of obfuscation can make header files declare different things depending on how many times they are included. This becomes especially interesting when one header is included in another header. Here is a particularly devious example:

As a corollary, never document the units of measure of any conversion constants, or how the values were derived. It is mild cheating, but very effective, to salt the code with some incorrect units of measure in the comments. If you are feeling particularly malicious, make up your own unit of measure; name it after yourself or some obscure person and never define it.

<pre>The cardinal rule of writing unmaintainable code is to specify each fact in as many places as possible and in as many ways as possible.
- Roedy Green</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The key to writing maintainable code is to specify each fact about the application in only one place. To change your mind, you need change it in only one place, and you are guaranteed the entire program will still work. Therefore, the key to writing unmaintainable code is to specify a fact over and over, in as many places as possible, in as many variant ways as possible. Happily, languages like Java go out of their way to make writing this sort of unmaintainable code easy. For example, it is almost impossible to change the type of a widely used variable because all the casts and conversion functions will no longer work, and the types of the associated temporary variables will no longer be appropriate. Further, if the variable is displayed on the screen, all the associated display and data entry code has to be tracked down and manually modified. The Algol family of languages which include C and Java treat storing data in an array, Hashtable, flat file and database with totally different syntax. In languages like Abundance, and to some extent Smalltalk, the syntax is identical; just the declaration changes. Take advantage of Java's ineptitude. Put data you know will grow too large for RAM, for now into an array. That way the maintenance programmer will have a horrendous task converting from array to file access later. Similarly place tiny files in databases so the maintenance programmer can have the fun of converting them to array access when it comes time to performance tune.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>Java Casts
Java's casting scheme is a gift from the Gods. You can use it without guilt since the language requires it. Every time you retrieve an object from a Collection you must cast it back to its original type. Thus the type of the variable may be specified in dozens of places. If the type later changes, all the casts must be changed to match. The compiler may or may not detect if the hapless maintenance programmer fails to catch them all (or changes one too many). In a similar way, all matching casts to (short) need to be changed to (int) if the type of a variable changes from short to int. There is a movement afoot in invent a generic cast operator (cast) and a generic conversion operator (convert) that would require no maintenance when the type of variable changes. Make sure this heresy never makes it into the language specification. Vote no on RFE 114691 and on genericity which would eliminate the need for many casts.</pre>

<pre>Dummy Interfaces
Write an empty interface called something like "WrittenByMe", and make all of your classes implement it. Then, write wrapper classes for any of Java's built-in classes that you use. The idea is to make sure that every single object in your program implements this interface. Finally, write all methods so that both their arguments and return types are WrittenByMe. This makes it nearly impossible to figure out what some methods do, and introduces all sorts of entertaining casting requirements. For a further extension, have each team member have his/her own personal interface (e.g., WrittenByJoe); any class worked on by a programmer gets to implement his/her interface. You can then arbitrary refer to objects by any one of a large number of meaningless interfaces!</pre>

<pre>Wrap, wrap, wrap
Whenever you have to use methods in code you did not write, insulate your code from that other dirty code by at least one layer of wrapper. After all, the other author might some time in the future recklessly rename every method. Then where would you be? You could of course, if he did such a thing, insulate your code from the changes by writing a wrapper or you could let VAJ handle the global rename. However, this is the perfect excuse to preemptively cut him off at the pass with a wrapper layer of indirection, before he does anything idiotic. One of Java's main faults is that there is no way to solve many simple problems without dummy wrapper methods that do nothing but call another method of the same name, or a closely related name. This means it is possible to write wrappers four-levels deep that do absolutely nothing, and almost no one will notice. To maximise the obscuration, at each level, rename the methods, selecting random synonyms from a thesaurus. This gives the illusion something of note is happening. Further, the renaming helps ensure the lack of consistent project terminology. To ensure no one attempts to prune your levels back to a reasonable number, invoke some of your code bypassing the wrappers at each of the levels.</pre>

In Java, disdain the interface. If your supervisors complain, tell them that Java interfaces force you to "cut-and-paste" code between different classes that implement the same interface the same way, and they know how hard that would be to maintain. Instead, do as the Java AWT designers did - put lots of functionality in your classes that can only be used by classes that inherit from them, and use lots of "instanceof" checks in your methods. This way, if someone wants to reuse your code, they have to extend your classes. If they want to reuse your code from two different classes - tough luck, they can't extend both of them at once! If an interface is unavoidable, make an all-purpose one and name it something like "ImplementableIface."

The advantage is that the initializer methods get called as soon as the class program binaries get loaded, even before any of the classes get instantiated, so they will usually get executed before the program main().

Never use typeface, colour, caps, or any other visual clues to help the reader distinguish the two. Use the exact same punctuation glyphs in your BNF notation that you use in the command language itself, so the reader can never tell if a (...), [...], {...} or "..." is something you actually type as part of the command, or is intended to give clues about which syntax elements are obligatory, repeatable or optional in your BNF notation.

Reverse the usual definitions of true and false. Sounds very obvious but it works great. You can hide:

    if ( var == TRUE )
    if ( var != FALSE ) someone is bound to "correct" the apparent redundancy, and use var elsewhere in the usual way:
    if ( var ) Another technique is to make TRUE and FALSE have the same value, though most would consider that out and out cheating. Using values 1 and 2 or -1 and 0 is a more subtle way to trip people up and still look respectable. You can use this same technique in Java by defining a static constant called TRUE.

They will again be grateful to you for the enjoyment of the process that they will have to follow to find out that the error was there all along. Extra bonus points make sure that your program cannot possibly compile with any of the compiler error checking diagnostics enabled.

Never put out a "bug fix only" release. Be sure to combine bug fixes with database format changes, complex user interface changes, and complete rewrites of the administration interfaces. That way, it will be so hard to upgrade that people will get used to the bugs and start calling them features. And the people that really want these "features" to work differently will have an incentive to upgrade to the new versions. This will save you maintenance work in the long run, and get you more revenue from your customers.</pre>

<pre>Change File Formats With Each Release Of Your Product
Yeah, your customers will demand upwards compatibility, so go ahead and do that. But make sure that there is no backwards compatibility. That will prevent customers from backing out the newer release, and coupled with a sensible bug fix policy (see above), will guarantee that once on a newer release, they will stay there. Extra bonus points Figure out how to get the old version to not even recognise files created by the newer versions. That way, they not only can't read them, they will deny that they are even created by the same application! Hint PC word processors provide a useful example of this sophisticated behaviour.</pre>

<pre>Compensate For Bugs
Don't worry about finding the root cause of bugs in the code. Simply put in compensating code in the higher-level routines. This is a great intellectual exercise, akin to 3D chess, and will keep future code maintainers entertained for hours as they try to figure out whether the problem is in the low-level routines that generate the data or in the high-level routines that change various cases all around. This technique is great for compilers, which are inherently multi-pass programs. You can completely avoid fixing problems in the early passes by simply making the later passes more complicated. With luck, you will never have to speak to the little snot who supposedly maintains the front-end of the compiler. Extra bonus points make sure the back-end breaks if the front-end ever generates the correct data.</pre>

<pre>Use Spin Locks
Avoid actual synchronization primitives in favor of a variety of spin locks -- repeatedly sleep then test a (non-volatile) global variable until it meets your criterion. Spin locks are much easier to use and more "general" and "flexible " than the system objects.</pre>

<pre>Sprinkle sync code liberally
Sprinkle some system synchronization primitives in places where they are not needed. I came across one critical section in a section of code where there was no possibility of a second thread. I challenged the original developer and he indicated that it helped document that the code was, well, "critical!"</pre>

<pre>Graceful Degradation
If your system includes an NT device driver, require the application to malloc I/O buffers and lock them in memory for the duration of any transactions, and free/unlock them after. This will result in an application that crashes NT if prematurely terminated with that buffer locked. But nobody at the client site likely will be able to change the device driver, so they won't have a choice.</pre>

<pre>A Real Life Example
Here's a real life example written by a master. Let's look at all the different techniques he packed into this single C function.
    void* Realocate(void*buf, int os, int ns)
    {
        void*temp;
        temp = malloc(os);
        memcpy((void*)temp, (void*)buf, os);
        free(buf);
        buf = malloc(ns);
        memset(buf, 0, ns);
        memcpy((void*)buf, (void*)temp, ns);
        return buf; }
    Reinvent simple functions which are part of the standard libraries.
    The word Realocate is not spelled correctly. Never underestimate the power of creative spelling.
    Make a temporary copy of input buffer for no real reason.
    Cast things for no reason. memcpy() takes (void*), so cast our pointers even though they're already (void*). Bonus for the fact that you could pass anything anyway.
    Never bothered to free temp. This will cause a slow memory leak, that may not show up until the program has been running for days.
    Copy more than necessary from the buffer just in case. This will only cause a core dump on Unix, not Windows.
    It should be obvious that os and ns stand for "old size" and "new size".
    After allocating buf, memset it to 0. Don't use calloc() because somebody might rewrite the ANSI spec so that calloc() fills the buffer with something other than 0. (Never mind the fact that we're about to copy exactly the same amount of data into buf.)</pre>

<pre>It's The Size That Counts
It almost goes without saying that the larger a function is, the better it is. And the more jumps and GOTOs the better. That way, any change must be analysed through many scenarios. It snarls the maintenance programmer in the spaghettiness of it all. And if the function is truly gargantuan, it becomes the Godzilla of the maintenance programmers, stomping them mercilessly to the ground before they have an idea of what's happened.</pre>

<pre>A Picture is a 1000 Words; A Function is 1000 Lines

<pre>One Missing File
Make sure that one or more critical files is missing. This is best done with includes of includes. For example, in your main module, you have
    #include &lt;stdcode.h&gt; Stdcode.h is available. But in stdcode.h, there's a reference to
    #include "a:\\refcode.h" and refcode.h is no where to be found.</pre>

<pre>Write Everywhere, Read Nowhere
At least one variable should be set everywhere and used almost nowhere. Unfortunately, modern compilers usually stop you from doing the reverse, read everywhere, write nowhere, but you can still do it in C or C++.</pre>

<p>Philosophy</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The people who design languages are the people who write the compilers and system classes. Quite naturally they design to make their work easy and mathematically elegant. However, there are 10,000 maintenance programmers to every compiler writer. The grunt maintenance programmers have absolutely no say in the design of languages. Yet the total amount of code they write dwarfs the code in the compilers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of the result of this sort of elitist thinking is the JDBC interface. It makes life easy for the JDBC implementor, but a nightmare for the maintenance programmer. It is far clumsier than the FORTRAN interface that came out with SQL three decades ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintenance programmers, if somebody ever consulted them, would demand ways to hide the housekeeping details so they could see the forest for the trees. They would demand all sorts of shortcuts so they would not have to type so much and so they could see more of the program at once on the screen. They would complain loudly about the myriad petty time-wasting tasks the compilers demand of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some efforts in this direction NetRexx, Bali, and visual editors (e.g. IBM&#8217;s Visual Age is a start) that can collapse detail irrelevant to the current purpose.</p>

<p>The Shoemaker Has No Shoes</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine having an accountant as a client who insisted on maintaining his general ledgers using a word processor. You would do you best to persuade him that his data should be structured. He needs validation with cross field checks. You would persuade him he could do so much more with that data when stored in a database, including controlled simultaneous update.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine taking on a software developer as a client. He insists on maintaining all his data (source code) with a text editor. He is not yet even exploiting the word processor&#8217;s colour, type size or fonts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of what might happen if we started storing source code as structured data. We could view the same source code in many alternate ways, e.g. as Java, as NextRex, as a decision table, as a flow chart, as a loop structure skeleton (with the detail stripped off), as Java with various levels of detail or comments removed, as Java with highlights on the variables and method invocations of current interest, or as Java with generated comments about argument names and/or types. We could display complex arithmetic expressions in 2D, the way TeX and mathematicians do. You could see code with additional or fewer parentheses, (depending on how comfortable you feel with the precedence rules). Parenthesis nests could use varying size and colour to help matching by eye. With changes as transparent overlay sets that you can optionally remove or apply, you could watch in real time as other programmers on your team, working in a different country, modified code in classes that you were working on too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could use the full colour abilities of the modern screen to give subliminal clues, e.g. by automatically assigning a portion of the spectrum to each package/class using a pastel shades as the backgrounds to any references to methods or variables of that class. You could bold face the definition of any identifier to make it stand out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could ask what methods/constructors will produce an object of type X? What methods will accept an object of type X as a parameter? What variables are accessible in this point in the code? By clicking on a method invocation or variable reference, you could see its definition, helping sort out which version of a given method will actually be invoked. You could ask to globally visit all references to a given method or variable, and tick them off once each was dealt with. You could do quite a bit of code writing by point and click.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these ideas would not pan out. But the best way to find out which would be valuable in practice is to try them. Once we had the basic tool, we could experiment with hundreds of similar ideas to make life easier for the maintenance programmer.</p>

<p>This essay is a joke! I apologise if anyone took this literally. Canadians think it gauche to label jokes with a :-). People paid no attention when I harped about how to write __maintainable code. I found people were more receptive hearing all the goofy things people often do to muck it up. Checking for unmaintainable design patterns is a rapid way to defend against malicious or inadvertent sloppiness.</p>
