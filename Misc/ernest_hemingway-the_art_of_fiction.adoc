INTERVIEWER::
Do you do any rewriting as you read up to the place you left off the day before?
Or does that come later, when the whole is finished?
HEMINGWAY::
I always rewrite each day up to the point where I stopped. When it is all
finished, naturally you go over it. You get another chance to correct and
rewrite when someone else types it, and you see it clean in type. The last
chance is in the proofs. You’re grateful for these different chances.

HEMINGWAY::
On the Star you were forced to learn to write a simple declarative sentence.
This is useful to anyone.

INTERVIEWER::
These questions which inquire into craftsmanship really are an annoyance.

HEMINGWAY::
A sensible question is neither a delight nor an annoyance. I still believe,
though, that it is very bad for a writer to talk about how he writes. He writes
to be read by the eye and no explanations or dissertations should be necessary.
You can be sure that there is much more there than will be read at any first
reading and having made this it is not the writer’s province to explain it or to
run guided tours through the more difficult country of his work.

INTERVIEWER::
How do you name your characters?
HEMINGWAY::
The best I can.

INTERVIEWER::
Do the titles come to you while you’re in the process of doing the story?
HEMINGWAY::
No. I make a list of titles after I’ve finished the story or the book—sometimes
as many as a hundred. Then I start eliminating them, sometimes all of them.

INTERVIEWER:: So when you’re not writing, you remain constantly the observer,
looking for something which can be of use.
HEMINGWAY::
Surely. If a writer stops observing he is finished. But he does not have to
observe consciously nor think how it will be useful. Perhaps that would be true
at the beginning. But later everything he sees goes into the great reserve of
things he knows or has seen. If it is any use to know it, I always try to write
on the principle of the iceberg. There is seven-eighths of it underwater for
every part that shows. Anything you know you can eliminate and it only
strengthens your iceberg. It is the part that doesn’t show. If a writer omits
something because he does not know it then there is a hole in the story.
