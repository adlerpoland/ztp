Convert Procedural Design to Objects::
  Turn the data records into objects, break up the behavior,
  and move the behavior to the objects.
Separate Domain from Presentation::
  Move the domain logic into the model.

As you do this refactoring you have to pay attention to where your risk is. If
the intermingling of presentation and domain logic is the biggest risk, get
them completely separated before you do much else.
