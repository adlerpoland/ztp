# Big Refactorings of Ant Colonies

Convert Procedural Design to Objects::
  Turn the data records into objects, break up the behavior,
  and move the behavior to the objects.
Separate Domain from Presentation::
  Move the domain logic into the model.
+
As you do this refactoring you have to pay attention to where your risk is. If
the intermingling of presentation and domain logic is the biggest risk, get
them completely separated before you do much else.

## Convert Procedural Design to Objects

[quote, Jay Fields et al., Refactoring – Ruby Edition]
____
A client of ours once started a project with two absolute principles the
developers  had to follow:

. You must use Java.
. You must not use objects.

### Version 1.0, codename „Procedural Code”

W pierwszej wersji link:lib/ant.rb[ant.rb] zrobiono kilka założeń:

- nie ma tablicy mrówek, ani obiektu mrówka
- jest plansza 2d jako cały obiekt, który robi wszystko, czyli 'mrowisko'
- mrówka robi krok o 1 pole w losowo wybranym kierunku, kierunków jest 8
- puste miejsce na planszy to w tablicy 0, mrówka to w tablicy 1
- gdy mrówki wejdą na to samo miejsce, jedna z nich znika (mój błąd - w efekcie
  zadeptują się i z dwóch jedynek zostaje tylko jedna, zostawiłem to)
- gdy mrówka wejdzie na krawędź planszy, pojawia się po przeciwnej stronie
- całość jest rysowana wiersz po wierszu


### How to Refactor?

. Take each record type and turn it into a dumb data object with accessors. +
   ➨ _If you have a relational database, take each table and turn it into
   a dumb data object._
. Take all the procedural code and put it into a single class. +
   ➨ _You can make the methods class methods._
. Take each long procedure and apply Extract Method and the related
   refactorings to break it down. As you break down the procedures,
   use Move Method to move each one to the appropriate dumb data class.
. Continue until you’ve removed all the behavior away from the original class.
  If the original class was a purely procedural class, it’s very gratifying to
  delete it.


















## Separate Domain from Presentation

How to Refactor?

. Identify functionality in the controllers that does not have anything to do
  with accepting user requests, organizing for the model to do its work, or
  triggering the appropriate views to be displayed.
. Examine this code to determine a domain object on which it could be put. +
  ➨ _Add a new domain object if necessary._ +
  ➨ _Use of Extract Method may be required prior to moving the offending code.
  The shortcuts that lead to domain logic landing in views and controllers
  also often mix up presentation and domain logic within the methods._
. Use Move Method to move it to the domain object.
. Test.
. Identify code in the views that is not concerned with display logic.
. Examine this code to determine a domain object on which it could be put. +
  ➨ _Add a new domain object if necessary._ +
  ➨ _Again, use of Extract Method may be required prior to moving
  the offending code._
. Use Move Method to move it to the domain object.
. Test.
. When you are finished, you will have views that handle the GUI, control- lers
  that handle request marshaling, and domain objects that contain all the
  business logic. The domain objects may be well factored, but further
  refactorings will deal with that.
